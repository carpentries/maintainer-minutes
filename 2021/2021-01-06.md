## Questions/Goals

- Dan: Get basic github stats from all repos
- Q for Christina: updating styles pulls from the styles repo and merge directly into current repo?
    - A: pretty simple, keep all the new things, and merge
    - Eventually we won't need to merge in new styles, and the only thing in the repo will be the content
        - Hopefully this will deal with projects that are really behind in styles and the style version won't matter
- Christina: go through notes from SQL discussion earlier today - complete!!
