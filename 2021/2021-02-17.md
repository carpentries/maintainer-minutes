- process
    - Markdown -> Jekyll -> Make -> Python
- Issues:
    - Make on windows
    - Style updates require huge PRs to the repos
- Lesson template wasn't possible before, we wrapped it around a "blog" format

    - New template will use R + Pandoc
        - R is cross platform
        - RMarkdown is robust
        - RStudio IDE works on desktop + cloud
        - Package infrastructure "just works"
        - Staging area for rendered contenct
        - No more blockquotes (pandoc fenced divs)
        - Styles are automatic
        - PR helper bots
        - More intuiative layout
- Rollout
    - March polish tools
    - April Alpha testing (looking for volunteers)

- Q+A
    - Rollout?
        - It will be opt-in inititally
        - One time process Zhian will send PR
    - Alpha + Beta phase will walk though how to transition in detail
    - Painpoints around changing software stack
        - There will always be  painpoints
        - Current stack is not manageable, which this will address
    - Does make work with WSL?
        - Yes it does, but not everyone will be able to upgrade windows 10 to be compatiable with WSL
    - How do maintainers coordinate with other maintainers about this transition?
        - Ask in a github issue to ask other matinainers, but feel free to make changes on your own if you feel it's approporiate if you don't hear back from the group (within a week)

##### Maintainer Guideline task force
